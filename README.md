Visualizing Proportions, Nested Proportions and Distributions in Titanic Dataset

## About the Project

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used in data analysis to explore survival patterns of passengers aboard the Titanic. 
It contains information on passengers, including demographic details (age, gender, class), ticket and cabin details, and whether they survived the shipwreck.
This dataset is commonly used for classification tasks, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to uncover factors influencing survival.

## Analysis Techniques Used

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** is the initial step where you explore a dataset to understand its underlying structure and features. The goal is to:

* Summarize key statistics to understand data distribution.
* Identify data types and patterns, such as categorical vs. numerical variables and trends.
* Detect anomalies or missing data, which could affect analysis outcomes.
* Visualize relationships between variables using plots.

## Findings and Insights

-**Survival Proportions:**

Female survivors outnumber male survivors.

-**Passenger Class:**

Most female and male survivors were from Passenger Class 3.

-**Embarkation Ports:**

Least number of passengers (123) embarked from Port Q (both males and females).
Maximum passengers embarked from Port S (291 females, 623 males).
Port C had 147 males and 113 females embarking.

-**Age Group Insights:**

Maximum number of passengers were in the 15-35 age group.
Fewer senior citizens (>60 years).
Majority of females were in the 20-25 age group, and most males in the 20-30 age group.

-**Survival by Age Group:**

Most female survivors were aged 20-25, while male survivors were mostly in the 25-30 age group.
Percentage change is greater on weekends compared to weekdays.
